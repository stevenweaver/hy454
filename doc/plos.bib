  abstract = {This review is motivated by the true explosion in the number of recent
	studies both developing and ameliorating probabilistic models of
	codon evolution. Traditionally parametric, the first codon models
	focused on estimating the effects of selective pressure on the protein
	via an explicit parameter in the maximum likelihood framework. Likelihood
	ratio tests of nested codon models armed the biologists with powerful
	tools, which provided unambiguous evidence for positive selection
	in real data. This, in turn, triggered a new wave of methodological
	developments. The new generation of models views the codon evolution
	process in a more sophisticated way, relaxing several mathematical
	assumptions. These models make a greater use of physicochemical amino
	acid properties, genetic code machinery, and the large amounts of
	data from the public domain. The overview of the most recent advances
	on modeling codon evolution is presented here, and a wide range of
	their applications to real data is discussed. On the downside, availability
	of a large variety of models, each accounting for various biological
	factors, increases the margin for misinterpretation; the biological
	meaning of certain parameters may vary among models, and model selection
	procedures also deserve greater attention. Solid understanding of
	the modeling assumptions and their applicability is essential for
	successful statistical data analysis.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Identification of low-frequency variants is of clinical
	importance in the identification of preexisting drug resistance.
	Using 'ultra-deep' sequencing, we address the detection of potential
	resistance to the chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) antagonist,
	maraviroc, due to the pretreatment presence of low levels of chemokine
	(CXC motif) receptor 4 (CXCR4)-using virus. METHODS: We present a
	novel protocol for the phenotyping of HIV based on '454' pyrosequence
	data and apply this to two large data sets comprised of 104 628 (before
	treatment, day 1) and 191 637 (after treatment, day 11) reads from
	the envelope region. We study resistance in the context of the evolutionary
	history of the intrapatient viral population. Variation was also
	investigated both within and outside the V3 region, the region associated
	with the receptor switch. RESULTS: CXCR4-using virus can be detected
	at low frequency prior to maraviroc treatment ( approximately 0.5%)
	and at high frequency after failure of monotherapy ( approximately
	81%). Inferring an evolutionary tree from the 1674 unique reads that
	span the V3 region confirms that the CXCR4-using population emerged
	from low-frequency CXCR4-using variants present before treatment.
	Changes in the frequency of amino acid residues used at individual
	sites were found in regions outside the V3 region, indicative of
	other potential sites associated with receptor usage. CONCLUSION:
	We have provided a high-resolution snapshot of intrapatient viral
	variation, prior and after treatment with maraviroc, and detected
	preexisting CXCR4-using variants present at an extremely low frequency.
	The evolutionary analysis demonstrates the extent of diversity present
	at a single time point within an infected individual and the rapid
	effect of drug pressure on the structure of a viral population.},

	a milestone in genome sequencing in terms of performance and cost.
	Throughout the three available releases, average read lengths have
	increased to approximately 500 base pairs and are thus approaching
	read lengths obtained from traditional Sanger sequencing. Study design
	of sequencing projects would benefit from being able to simulate
	experiments. RESULTS: We explore 454 raw data to investigate its
	characteristics and derive empirical distributions for the flow values
	generated by pyrosequencing. Based on our findings, we implement
	Flowsim, a simulator that generates realistic pyrosequencing data
	files of arbitrary size from a given set of input DNA sequences.
	We finally use our simulator to examine the impact of sequence lengths
	on the results of concrete whole-genome assemblies, and we suggest
	its use in planning of sequencing projects, benchmarking of assembly
	methods and other fields. AVAILABILITY: Flowsim is freely available

	approach to DNA sequencing (the 454 sequencing). It is based on the
	pyrosequencing protocol. The 454 sequencing aims to give reliable
	output at a low cost and in a short time. The produced sequences
	are shorter than reads produced by classical methods. Our paper proposes
	a new DNA assembly algorithm which deals well with such data and
	outperforms other assembly algorithms used in practice. The constructed
	SR-ASM algorithm is a heuristic method based on a graph model, the
	graph being a modified DNA graph proposed for DNA sequencing by hybridization
	procedure. Other new features of the assembly algorithm are, among
	others, temporary compression of input sequences, and a new and fast
	multiple alignment heuristics taking advantage of the way the output
	data for the 454 sequencing are presented and coded. The usefulness
	of the algorithm has been proved in tests on raw data generated during
	sequencing of the whole 1.84Mbp genome of Prochlorococcus marinus
	bacteria and also on a part of chromosome 15 of Homo sapiens. The
	source code of SR-ASM can be downloaded from http://bio.cs.put.poznan.pl/

  abstract = {BACKGROUND. Primary infection with the human immunodeficiency virus
	(HIV-1) frequently causes an acute, self-limited viral syndrome.
	To examine the relations among viral replication, the immune response
	of the host, and clinical illness during this initial phase of infection,
	we undertook a quantitative, molecular, and biologic analysis of
	infectious HIV-1 in the blood and plasma of three patients with symptomatic
	primary infection and of a sexual partner of one of them. METHODS.
	During an eight-week period of primary infection, HIV-1 was cultured
	frequently in dilutions of plasma and peripheral-blood mononuclear
	cells (PBMC), and levels of HIV-1 antigen and antibody were determined
	sequentially by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunoblotting.
	Replication-competent HIV-1 proviruses were cloned and characterized
	biologically. RESULTS. Six to 15 days after the onset of symptoms,
	high titers of infectious HIV-1 (from 10 to 10(3) tissue-culture-infective
	doses per milliliter of plasma) and viral p24 antigen were detected
	in the plasma of all three patients. These titers fell precipitously
	by day 27, and the decline coincided with an increase in the levels
	of antiviral antibodies and the resolution of symptoms. Sequential
	isolates of virus from plasma and PBMC obtained throughout the period
	of primary infection, as well as virus derived from two molecular
	proviral clones, were highly cytopathic for normal-donor PBMC and
	immortalized T cells, despite the marked reduction in the titers
	of virus in plasma. CONCLUSIONS. Primary, symptomatic HIV-1 infection
	is associated with high titers of cytopathic, replication-competent
	viral strains, and during such infection potential infectivity is
	enhanced. Effective control of HIV-1 replication during primary infection
	implies the activation of clinically important mechanisms of immune
	defense that merit further examination in relation to the development
	of antiviral therapy and vaccines.},

	obtained from an individual who progressed from seroconversion to
	AIDS in approximately 5 years. HIV-1 isolated soon after seroconversion
	replicated slowly and to low levels in cultures of peripheral blood
	mononuclear cells; however, subsequent isolates obtained during asymptomatic
	infection showed a marked increase in replication kinetics. This
	was examined in more detail by using a panel of 35 biological clones
	of HIV-1 generated from sequential patient peripheral blood mononuclear
	cell samples. Each clone was evaluated for replication in primary
	macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes and for the ability to induce
	syncytium formation in MT-2 cell cultures. Consistent with earlier
	observations, we found that all of the clones isolated just after
	seroconversion were slowly replicating and non-syncytium inducing
	(NSI). However, NSI variants with increased replication kinetics
	in macrophages were identified soon thereafter. These variants preceded
	the appearance of NSI and syncytium-inducing variants, with rapid
	replication in both macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes. To determine
	whether changes in the rate of replication could be traced to the
	early stages of the virus life cycle, PCR assays were used to evaluate
	entry and reverse transcription of selected biological clones in
	macrophages and CD4+ T lymphocytes. We found there was no inherent
	block to entry or reverse transcription for the slowly replicating
	variants; however, this does not preclude the possibility that small
	differences in the rate of entry may account for larger differences
	in the replication kinetics over many cycles. Overall, our results
	demonstrate that rapidly replicating variants of HIV-1 emerge during
	the asymptomatic period in a patient who subsequently progressed

	METHODS AND RESULTS. Titers of infectious HIV-1 were determined by
	end-point-dilution culture in sequential samples of plasma and peripheral-blood
	mononuclear cells from four patients with primary infection, with
	peak titers of 1000 to 10,000 tissue-culture-infective doses per

	method. In as little as 10 days, the high HIV-1 load in both plasma
	and cells decreased spontaneously and precipitously, at least 100-fold,
	in all four patients. CONCLUSIONS. Although p24 core antigenemia
	and viral isolation have previously been described during primary

  abstract = {Codon models of evolution have facilitated the interpretation of selective
	forces operating on genomes. These models, however, assume a single
	rate of non-synonymous substitution irrespective of the nature of
	amino acids being exchanged. Recent developments have shown that
	models which allow for amino acid pairs to have independent rates
	of substitution offer improved fit over single rate models. However,
	these approaches have been limited by the necessity for large alignments
	in their estimation. An alternative approach is to assume that substitution
	rates between amino acid pairs can be subdivided into rate classes,
	dependent on the information content of the alignment. However, given
	the combinatorially large number of such models, an efficient model
	search strategy is needed. Here we develop a Genetic Algorithm (GA)
	method for the estimation of such models. A GA is used to assign
	amino acid substitution pairs to a series of rate classes, where
	is estimated from the alignment. Other parameters of the phylogenetic
	Markov model, including substitution rates, character frequencies
	and branch lengths are estimated using standard maximum likelihood
	optimization procedures. We apply the GA to empirical alignments
	and show improved model fit over existing models of codon evolution.
	Our results suggest that current models are poor approximations of
	protein evolution and thus gene and organism specific multi-rate
	models that incorporate amino acid substitution biases are preferred.
	We further anticipate that the clustering of amino acid substitution
	rates into classes will be biologically informative, such that genes
	with similar functions exhibit similar clustering, and hence this
	clustering will be useful for the evolutionary fingerprinting of
	genes.},

	metabolic processes and development. This transcriptome sequence
	variation may be reflective of natural selection acting on the genomes

  abstract = {We used ultra-deep sequencing to obtain tens of thousands of HIV-1
	sequences from regions targeted by CD8+ T lymphocytes from longitudinal
	samples from three acutely infected subjects, and modeled viral evolution
	during the critical first weeks of infection. Previous studies suggested
	that a single virus established productive infection, but these conclusions
	were tempered because of limited sampling; now, we have greatly increased
	our confidence in this observation through modeling the observed
	earliest sample diversity based on vastly more extensive sampling.
	Conventional sequencing of HIV-1 from acute/early infection has shown
	different patterns of escape at different epitopes; we investigated
	the earliest escapes in exquisite detail. Over 3-6 weeks, ultradeep
	sequencing revealed that the virus explored an extraordinary array
	of potential escape routes in the process of evading the earliest
	CD8 T-lymphocyte responses--using 454 sequencing, we identified over
	50 variant forms of each targeted epitope during early immune escape,
	while only 2-7 variants were detected in the same samples via conventional
	sequencing. In contrast to the diversity seen within epitopes, non-epitope
	regions, including the Envelope V3 region, which was sequenced as
	a control in each subject, displayed very low levels of variation.
	In early infection, in the regions sequenced, the consensus forms
	did not have a fitness advantage large enough to trigger reversion
	to consensus amino acids in the absence of immune pressure. In one
	subject, a genetic bottleneck was observed, with extensive diversity
	at the second time point narrowing to two dominant escape forms by
	the third time point, all within two months of infection. Traces
	of immune escape were observed in the earliest samples, suggesting
	that immune pressure is present and effective earlier than previously
	reported; quantifying the loss rate of the founder virus suggests
	a direct role for CD8 T-lymphocyte responses in viral containment
	after peak viremia. Dramatic shifts in the frequencies of epitope

	viral escape. Here we combined DNA bar coding and massively parallel

	mutations present as 5% of the population could be readily detected
	without false positive calls. In three samples of multidrug-resistant
	HIV populations from patients, all the drug-resistant mutations called
	by conventional analysis were identified, as well as four additional
	low abundance drug resistance mutations, some of which would be expected
	to influence the response to antiretroviral therapy. Methods for

	sequencing technologies. In addition, we also present 'conflict resolution'
	improvements to our earlier combinatorial SV detection algorithm
	(VariationHunter) by taking the diploid nature of the human genome
	into consideration. We test our algorithms with simulated data from
	the Venter genome (HuRef) and are able to discover >85% of transposon
	insertion events with precision of >90%. We also demonstrate that

	BreakDancer and MoDIL) algorithms when tested on the genome of the
	Yoruba African individual (NA18507). AVAILABILITY: The implementation

	that natural selection favoring escape mutations led to an increase
	in the frequency of haplotypes in the epitope region that differed
	from the inoculum. After 20 weeks of infection, a new sequence haplotype
	in the epitope region had increased to a frequency greater than 50%

	haplotype was not the same in all four monkeys. Thus, even under

	nature of mutation itself is the primary factor affecting which escape
	mutation is likely to become predominant within an individual host.
	The relationship between the frequency of the inoculum haplotype
	in the epitope region and time post-infection approximated a simple

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Surveillance for HIV transmitted drug resistance (TDR)
	is performed using HIV genotype results from individual specimens.
	Pyrosequencing, through its massive parallel sequencing ability,
	can analyze large numbers of specimens simultaneously. Instead of
	using pyrosequencing conventionally, to sequence a population of
	viruses within an individual, we interrogated a single combined pool
	of surveillance specimens to demonstrate that it is possible to determine
	TDR rates in HIV protease from a population of individuals. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL
	FINDINGS: The protease region from 96 treatment naive, HIV+ serum
	specimens was genotyped using standard Sanger sequencing method.
	The 462 bp protease amplicons from these specimens were pooled in
	equimolar concentrations and re-sequenced using the GS FLX Titanium
	system. The nucleotide (NT) and amino acid (AA) differences from
	the reference sequence, along with TDR mutations, detected by each
	method were compared. In the protease sequence, there were 212 nucleotide
	and 81 AA differences found using conventional sequencing and 345
	nucleotide and 168 AA differences using pyrosequencing. All nucleotide
	and amino acid polymorphisms found at frequencies >/=5% in pyrosequencing
	were detected using both methods with the rates of variation highly
	correlated. Using Sanger sequencing, two TDR mutations, M46L and
	I84V, were each detected as mixtures at a frequency of 1.04% (1/96).
	These same TDR mutations were detected by pyrosequencing with a prevalence
	of 0.29% and 0.34% respectively. Phylogenetic analysis established
	that the detected low frequency mutations arose from the same single
	specimens that were found to contain TDR mutations by Sanger sequencing.
	Multiple clinical protease DR mutations present at higher frequencies
	were concordantly identified using both methods. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE:
	We show that pyrosequencing pooled surveillance specimens can cost-competitively
	detect protease TDR mutations when compared with conventional methods.
	With few modifications, the method described here can be used to
	determine population rates of TDR in both protease and reverse transcriptase.
	Furthermore, this pooled pyrosequencing technique may be generalizable
	to other infectious agents where a survey of DR rates is required.},

	drug-resistant variants at levels under limit of detection of conventional
	genotyping (<20% of quasi-species) are present in antiretroviral-experienced
	persons experiencing virologic failure. Further, the clinical implications
	of low-abundance drug-resistant variants at time of virologic failure
	are unknown. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Plasma samples from
	22 antiretroviral-experienced subjects collected at time of virologic
	failure (viral load 1380 to 304,000 copies/mL) were obtained from
	a specimen bank (from 2004-2007). The prevalence and profile of drug-resistant
	mutations were determined using Sanger sequencing and ultra-deep
	pyrosequencing. Genotypes were interpreted using Stanford HIV database
	algorithm. Antiretroviral treatment histories were obtained by chart
	review and correlated with drug-resistant mutations. Low-abundance
	drug-resistant mutations were detected in all 22 subjects by deep
	sequencing and only in 3 subjects by Sanger sequencing. In total
	they accounted for 90 of 247 mutations (36%) detected by deep sequencing;
	the majority of these (95%) were not detected by standard genotyping.
	A mean of 4 additional mutations per subject were detected by deep
	sequencing (p<0.0001, 95%CI: 2.85-5.53). The additional low-abundance
	drug-resistant mutations increased a subject's genotypic resistance
	to one or more antiretrovirals in 17 of 22 subjects (77%). When correlated
	with subjects' antiretroviral treatment histories, the additional
	low-abundance drug-resistant mutations correlated with the failing
	antiretroviral drugs in 21% subjects and correlated with historical
	antiretroviral use in 79% subjects (OR, 13.73; 95% CI, 2.5-74.3,
	p = 0.0016). CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Low-abundance HIV drug-resistant
	mutations in antiretroviral-experienced subjects at time of virologic
	failure can increase a subject's overall burden of resistance, yet
	commonly go unrecognized by conventional genotyping. The majority
	of unrecognized resistant mutations correlate with historical antiretroviral
	use. Ultra-deep sequencing can provide important historical resistance
	information for clinicians when planning subsequent antiretroviral
	regimens for highly treatment-experienced patients, particularly
	when their prior treatment histories and longitudinal genotypes are

  abstract = {The prominent role of antiviral cytotoxic CD8(+) T-lymphocytes (CD8-TL)
	in containing the acute viremia of human and simian immunodeficiency
	viruses (HIV-1 and SIV) has rationalized the development of T-cell-based
	vaccines. However, the presence of escape mutations in the acute
	stage of infection has raised a concern that accelerated escape from
	vaccine-induced CD8-TL responses might undermine vaccine efficacy.
	We reanalyzed previously published data of 101,822 viral genomes
	of three CD8-TL epitopes, Nef(103-111)RM9 (RM9), Tat(28-35)SL8 (SL8),
	and Gag(181-189)CM9 (CM9), sampled by ultradeep pyrosequencing from
	eight macaques. Multiple epitope variants appeared during the resolution
	of acute viremia, followed by the predominance of a single mutant
	epitope. By fitting a mathematical model, we estimated the first
	acute escape rate as 0.36 day(-1) within escape-prone epitopes, RM9
	and SL8, and the chronic escape rate as 0.014 day(-1) within the
	CM9 epitope. Our estimate of SIV acute escape rates was found to
	be comparable to very early HIV-1 escape rates. The timing of the
	first escape was more highly correlated with the timing of the peak
	CD8-TL response than with the magnitude of the CD8-TL response. The
	transmitted epitope decayed more than 400 times faster during the
	acute viral decline stage than predicted by a neutral evolution model.
	However, the founder epitope persisted as a minor population even
	at the viral set point; in contrast, the majority of acute escape
	epitopes were completely cleared. Our results suggest that a reservoir

  abstract = {MOTIVATION: Next-generation sequencing presents several statistical
	challenges, with one of the most fundamental being determining an
	individual's genotype from multiple aligned short read sequences
	at a position. Some simple approaches for genotype calling apply
	fixed filters, such as calling a heterozygote if more than a specified
	percentage of the reads have variant nucleotide calls. Other genotype-calling
	methods, such as MAQ and SOAPsnp, are implementations of Bayes classifiers
	in that they classify genotypes using posterior genotype probabilities.
	RESULTS: Here, we propose a novel genotype-calling algorithm that,
	in contrast to the other methods, estimates parameters underlying
	the posterior probabilities in an adaptive way rather than arbitrarily
	specifying them a priori. The algorithm, which we call SeqEM, applies
	the well-known Expectation-Maximization algorithm to an appropriate
	likelihood for a sample of unrelated individuals with next-generation
	sequence data, leveraging information from the sample to estimate
	genotype probabilities and the nucleotide-read error rate. We demonstrate
	using analytic calculations and simulations that SeqEM results in
	genotype-call error rates as small as or smaller than filtering approaches
	and MAQ. We also apply SeqEM to exome sequence data in eight related
	individuals and compare the results to genotypes from an Illumina
	SNP array, showing that SeqEM behaves well in real data that deviates
	from idealized assumptions. Conclusion: SeqEM offers an improved,
	robust and flexible genotype-calling approach that can be widely
	applied in the next-generation sequencing studies. Availability and

	were obtained from patients with prior exposure to at least two antiretroviral
	drug classes and who were on a failing antiretroviral regimen. Standard
	genotypes were obtained by reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR and sequencing
	of the bulk PCR product. For single-genome sequencing, cDNA derived
	from plasma RNA was serially diluted to 1 copy per reaction, and
	a region encompassing p6, protease, and a portion of RT was amplified
	and sequenced. Sequences from 15 to 46 single viral genomes were
	obtained from each plasma sample. Drug resistance mutations identified
	by single-genome sequencing were not detected by standard genotype
	analysis in 24 of the 26 patients studied. Mutations present in less
	than 10% of single genomes were almost never detected in standard
	genotypes (1 of 86). Similarly, mutations present in 10 to 35% of
	single genomes were detected only 25% of the time in standard genotypes.
	For example, in one patient, 10 mutations identified by single-genome
	sequencing and conferring resistance to protease inhibitors (PIs),

	reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) were not detected by standard

	linked PI mutations, none of which were present in the standard genotype.
	In another patient sample, 33% of genomes contained five linked NNRTI
	resistance mutations, none of which were detected by standard genotype
	analysis. These findings illustrate the inadequacy of the standard
	genotype for detecting low-frequency drug resistance mutations. In
	addition to having greater sensitivity, single-genome sequencing
	identifies linked mutations that confer high-level drug resistance.
	Such linkage cannot be detected by standard genotype analysis.},

	De novo assembly of sequence reads generated by classical Sanger
	capillary sequencing is a mature field of research. Unfortunately,
	the existing sequence assembly programs were not effective for short
	sequence reads generated by Illumina and SOLiD platforms. Early studies
	suggested that, in principle, sequence reads as short as 20-30 nucleotides
	could be used to generate useful assemblies of both prokaryotic and
	eukaryotic genome sequences, albeit containing many gaps. The early
	feasibility studies and proofs of principle inspired several bioinformatics
	research groups to implement new algorithms as freely available software
	tools specifically aimed at assembling reads of 30-50 nucleotides
	in length. This has led to the generation of several draft genome
	sequences based exclusively on short sequence Illumina sequence reads,
	recently culminating in the assembly of the 2.25-Gb genome of the
	giant panda from Illumina sequence reads with an average length of

	This apparent conflict between diversifying and purifying selection
	may be resolved by an abundance of epistatic interactions such that
	the same functional requirements can be met by highly divergent sequences.
	We investigate this hypothesis by conducting an extensive characterization
	of sequence variation in the HIV-1 nef gene that encodes a highly
	variable multifunctional protein. Population-based sequences were
	obtained from 686 patients enrolled in the HOMER cohort in British
	Columbia, Canada, from which the distribution of nonsynonymous substitutions
	in the phylogeny was reconstructed by maximum likelihood. We used
	a phylogenetic comparative method on these data to identify putative
	epistatic interactions between residues. Two interactions (Y120/Q125
	and N157/S169) were chosen to further investigate within-host evolution
	using HIV-1 RNA extractions from plasma samples from eight patients.
	Clonal sequencing confirmed strong linkage between polymorphisms
	at these sites in every case. We used massively parallel pyrosequencing
	(MPP) to reconstruct within-host evolution in these patients. Experimental
	error associated with MPP was quantified by performing replicates
	at two different stages of the protocol, which were pooled prior
	to analysis to reduce this source of variation. Phylogenetic reconstruction

	relation to other risk factors for the heterosexual transmission
	of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). In a community-based
	study of 15,127 persons in a rural district of Uganda, we identified
	415 couples in which one partner was HIV-1-positive and one was initially
	HIV-1-negative and followed them prospectively for up to 30 months.
	The incidence of HIV-1 infection per 100 person-years among the initially
	seronegative partners was examined in relation to behavioral and
	biologic variables. RESULTS: The male partner was HIV-1-positive
	in 228 couples, and the female partner was HIV-1-positive in 187
	couples. Ninety of the 415 initially HIV-1-negative partners seroconverted
	(incidence, 11.8 per 100 person-years). The rate of male-to-female
	transmission was not significantly different from the rate of female-to-male
	transmission (12.0 per 100 person-years vs. 11.6 per 100 person-years).
	The incidence of seroconversion was highest among the partners who
	were 15 to 19 years of age (15.3 per 100 person-years). The incidence
	was 16.7 per 100 person-years among 137 uncircumcised male partners,
	whereas there were no seroconversions among the 50 circumcised male
	partners (P<0.001). The mean serum HIV-1 RNA level was significantly
	higher among HIV-1-positive subjects whose partners seroconverted
	than among those whose partners did not seroconvert (90,254 copies
	per milliliter vs. 38,029 copies per milliliter, P=0.01). There were
	no instances of transmission among the 51 subjects with serum HIV-1
	RNA levels of less than 1500 copies per milliliter; there was a significant
	dose-response relation of increased transmission with increasing
	viral load. In multivariate analyses of log-transformed HIV-1 RNA
	levels, each log increment in the viral load was associated with
	a rate ratio of 2.45 for seroconversion (95 percent confidence interval,
	1.85 to 3.26). CONCLUSIONS: The viral load is the chief predictor
	of the risk of heterosexual transmission of HIV-1, and transmission
	is rare among persons with levels of less than 1500 copies of HIV-1
	RNA per milliliter.},

	of a number of different sequencing technologies. A population sampler
	optionally produces evolved sequences based on source genomes and

	during budding may give information on the cellular source of circulating
	virions. In the present study, by applying immunosorting of the virus
	and of the cells with antibodies targeting monocyte (CD36) and lymphocyte
	(CD26) markers, it was possible to directly compare HIV-1 quasispecies
	archived in circulating monocytes and T lymphocytes with that present
	in plasma virions originated from the same cell types. Five chronically
	HIV-1 infected patients who underwent therapy interruption after
	prolonged HAART were enrolled in the study. The analysis was performed
	by the powerful technology of ultra-deep pyrosequencing after PCR
	amplification of part of the env gene, coding for the viral glycoprotein
	(gp) 120, encompassing the tropism-related V3 loop region. V3 amino
	acid sequences were used to establish heterogeneity parameters, to
	build phylogenetic trees and to predict co-receptor usage. RESULTS:
	The heterogeneity of proviral and viral genomes derived from monocytes
	was higher than that of T-lymphocyte origin. Both monocytes and T
	lymphocytes might contribute to virus rebounding in the circulation
	after therapy interruptions, but other virus sources might also be
	involved. In addition, both proviral and circulating viral sequences
	from monocytes and T lymphocytes were predictive of a predominant

	most frequent quasispecies variants, were present. In particular,
	in proviral genomes harboured by monocytes, minority variant clusters
	with a predicted X4 phenotype were found. CONCLUSION: This study
	provided the first direct comparison between the HIV-1 quasispecies
	archived as provirus in circulating monocytes and T lymphocytes with
	that of plasma virions replicating in the same cell types. Ultra-deep
	pyrosequencing generated data with some order of magnitude higher

	present in archived proviral sequences and in actually replicating
	virions, which may have clinical and therapeutic relevance.},

  abstract = {To understand the high variability of the asymptomatic interval between
	primary human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection and
	the development of AIDS, we studied the evolution of the C2-V5 region
	of the HIV-1 env gene and of T-cell subsets in nine men with a moderate
	or slow rate of disease progression. They were monitored from the
	time of seroconversion for a period of 6 to 12 years until the development
	of advanced disease in seven men. Based on the analysis of viral
	divergence from the founder strain, viral population diversity within
	sequential time points, and the outgrowth of viruses capable of utilizing
	the CXCR4 receptor (X4 viruses), the existence of three distinct
	phases within the asymptomatic interval is suggested: an early phase
	of variable duration during which linear increases ( approximately
	1% per year) in both divergence and diversity were observed; an intermediate
	phase lasting an average of 1.8 years, characterized by a continued
	increase in divergence but with stabilization or decline in diversity;
	and a late phase characterized by a slowdown or stabilization of
	divergence and continued stability or decline in diversity. X4 variants
	emerged around the time of the early- to intermediate-phase transition
	and then achieved peak representation and began a decline around
	the transition between the intermediate and late phases. The late-phase
	transition was also associated with failure of T-cell homeostasis
	(defined by a downward inflection in CD3(+) T cells) and decline
	of CD4(+) T cells to </=200 cells/microliter. The strength of these
	temporal associations between viral divergence and diversity, viral
	coreceptor specificity, and T-cell homeostasis and subset composition
	supports the concept that the phases described represent a consistent
	pattern of viral evolution during the course of HIV-1 infection in
	moderate progressors. Recognition of this pattern may help explain
	previous conflicting data on the relationship between viral evolution
	and disease progression and may provide a useful framework for evaluating
	immune damage and recovery in untreated and treated HIV-1 infections.},

	virus (HIV) variants may go undetected, yet be clinically important.
	OBJECTIVES: To compare the prevalence of drug-resistant variants
	detected with standard and ultra-deep sequencing (detection down
	to 1% prevalence) and to determine the impact of minor resistant
	variants on virologic failure (VF). METHODS: The Flexible Initial
	Retrovirus Suppressive Therapies (FIRST) Study (N = 1397) compared
	3 initial antiretroviral therapy (ART) strategies. A random subset
	(n = 491) had baseline testing for drug-resistance mutations performed
	by use of standard sequencing methods. Ultra-deep sequencing was
	performed on samples that had sufficient viral content (N = 264).
	Proportional hazards models were used to compare rates of VF for
	those who did and did not have mutations identified. RESULTS: Mutations
	were detected by standard and ultra-deep sequencing (in 14% and 28%
	of participants, respectively; P < .001). Among individuals who initiated
	treatment with an ART regimen that combined nucleoside and nonnucleoside
	reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (hereafter, "NNRTI strategy"), all
	individuals who had an NNRTI-resistance mutation identified by ultra-deep
	sequencing experienced VF. When these individuals were compared with
	individuals who initiated treatment with the NNRTI strategy but who
	had no NNRTI-resistance mutations, the risk of VF was higher for
	those who had an NNRTI-resistance mutation detected by both methods
	(hazard ratio [HR], 12.40 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 3.41-45.10])
	and those who had mutation(s) detected only with ultra-deep sequencing
	(HR, 2.50 [95% CI, 1.17-5.36]). CONCLUSIONS: Ultra-deep sequencing
	identified a significantly larger proportion of HIV-infected, treatment-naive
	persons as harboring drug-resistant viral variants. Among participants
	who initiated treatment with the NNRTI strategy, the risk of VF was
	significantly greater for participants who had low- and high-prevalence

	sought to determine how often NNRTI-resistant mutations other than
	K103N occur as minority variants in plasma samples for which standard
	genotypic resistance testing detects K103N alone. METHODS: We performed

	20 NNRTI-experienced patients in whom standard genotypic resistance

	RESULTS: Samples from 0 of 13 treatment-naive patients vs. 7 of 20

	K65R confers intermediate to high-level resistance to the NRTIs abacavir,
	didanosine, emtricitabine, lamivudine, and tenofovir; and low-level
	resistance to stavudine. Several lines of evidence suggest that K65R
	is more common in HIV-1 subtype C than subtype B viruses. METHODS
	AND FINDINGS: We performed ultra-deep pyrosequencing (UDPS) and clonal
	dideoxynucleotide sequencing of plasma virus samples to assess the
	prevalence of minority K65R variants in subtype B and C viruses from
	untreated individuals. Although UDPS of plasma samples from 18 subtype
	C and 27 subtype B viruses showed that a higher proportion of subtype
	C viruses contain K65R (1.04% vs. 0.25%; p<0.001), limiting dilution
	clonal sequencing failed to corroborate its presence in two of the
	samples in which K65R was present in >1.5% of UDPS reads. We therefore
	performed UDPS on clones and site-directed mutants containing subtype
	B- and C-specific patterns of silent mutations in the conserved KKK
	motif encompassing RT codons 64 to 66 and found that subtype-specific
	nucleotide differences were responsible for increased PCR-induced
	K65R mutation in subtype C viruses. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows
	that the RT KKK nucleotide template in subtype C viruses can lead
	to the spurious detection of K65R by highly sensitive PCR-dependent
	sequencing techniques. However, the study is also consistent with
	the subtype C nucleotide template being inherently responsible for
	increased polymerization-induced K65R mutations in vivo.},

	sites are periodically distributed on the nucleosome surface, consistent
	with favored integration into outward-facing DNA major grooves in

	annotated ENCODE regions revealed a wealth of new associations between
	integration frequency and genomic features. Integration was particularly
	favored near transcription-associated histone modifications, including
	H3 acetylation, H4 acetylation, and H3 K4 methylation, but was disfavored
	in regions rich in transcription-inhibiting modifications, which
	include H3 K27 trimethylation and DNA CpG methylation. Statistical
	modeling indicated that effects of histone modification on HIV integration
	were partially independent of other genomic features influencing

	more and more events in healthy as well as disease-affected cells

	(NGS) extends that reach into multiple almost complete genomes of
	the same species, revealing more and more details about how individual
	genomes as well as individual aspects of their regulation differ
	from each other. The inclusion of NGS-based transcriptome sequencing,
	chromatin-immunoprecipitation (ChIP) of transcription factor binding
	and epigenetic analyses (usually based on DNA methylation or histone
	modification ChIP) completes the picture with unprecedented resolution
	enabling the detection of even subtle differences such as alternative
	splicing of individual exons. Functional genomics aims at the elucidation
	of the molecular basis of biological functions and requires analyses
	that go far beyond the primary analysis of the reads such as mapping
	to a genome template sequence. The various and complex interactions
	between the genome, gene products and metabolites define biological
	function, which necessitates inclusion of results other than sequence
	tags in quite elaborative approaches. However, the extra efforts
	pay off in revealing mechanisms as well as providing the foundation

	production of sequence data sets. Unfortunately these technologies
	also have a non-neglible sequencing error rate, which biases their
	outputs by introducing false reads and reducing the quantity of the

	false counts to a considerable degree, until now they have not been
	implemented in a scalable way. Recently, a program named FREC has
	been developed to address this problem for next generation sequencing
	data. In this paper, we introduce RECOUNT, our implementation of
	an Expectation Maximization algorithm for tag count correction and
	compare it to FREC. Using both the reference genome and simulated
	data, we find that RECOUNT performs as well or better than FREC,
	while using much less memory (e.g. 5GB vs. 75GB). Furthermore, we
	report the first analysis of tag count correction with real data
	in the context of gene expression analysis. Our results show that
	tag count correction not only increases the number of mappable tags,
	but can make a real difference in the biological interpretation of
	next generation sequencing data. RECOUNT is an open-source C++ program

	pattern of adaptive evolution within infected patients is critical
	to understanding the development of AIDS. Using sequence data from
	infected individuals sampled at multiple time points, I estimate
	the within-host adaptation rate of the HIV-1 env gene for viral populations
	from 50 different patients. I find that, averaging across patients,
	one adaptive substitution occurs every 3.3 months. Also, one adaptive
	mutation is driven to a high frequency (>50% but <100%) every 2.5
	months. Taken together, such adaptive events occur once every 25
	viral generations, which is the fastest adaptation rate ever recorded
	for a single protein-coding gene. Within the entire env gene, I estimate
	that a majority ([~]55%) of both nonsynonymous substitutions and
	high-frequency polymorphisms are adaptive. Further, in the C2-V5
	region of env, I find that patients with longer asymptomatic periods
	have virus populations with higher adaptation rates, corroborating
	the notion that a broad, strong immune response against epitopes
	in the env gene product leads to longer asymptomatic periods. I conclude
	by discussing the distribution of nonsynonymous changes over the

  abstract = 	{Comparative sequence analyses, including such fundamental bioinformatics techniques as similarity searching, sequence alignment and phylogenetic inference, have become a mainstay for researchers studying type 1 Human Immunodeficiency Virus ({HIV-1}) genome structure and evolution. Implicit in comparative analyses is an underlying model of evolution, and the chosen model can significantly affect the results. In general, evolutionary models describe the probabilities of replacing one amino acid character with another over a period of time. Most widely used evolutionary models for protein sequences have been derived from curated alignments of hundreds of proteins, usually based on mammalian genomes. It is unclear to what extent these empirical models are generalizable to a very different organism, such as {HIV-1-the} most extensively sequenced organism in existence. We developed a maximum likelihood model fitting procedure to a collection of {HIV-1} alignments sampled from different viral genes, and inferred two empirical substitution models, suitable for describing between-and within-host evolution. Our procedure pools the information from multiple sequence alignments, and provided software implementation can be run efficiently in parallel on a computer cluster. We describe how the inferred substitution models can be used to generate scoring matrices suitable for alignment and similarity searches. Our models had a consistently superior fit relative to the best existing models and to parameter-rich data-driven models when benchmarked on independent {HIV-1} alignments, demonstrating evolutionary biases in amino-acid substitution that are unique to {HIV}, and that are not captured by the existing models. The scoring matrices derived from the models showed a marked difference from common amino-acid scoring matrices. The use of an appropriate evolutionary model recovered a known viral transmission history, whereas a poorly chosen model introduced phylogenetic error. We argue that our model derivation procedure is immediately applicable to other organisms with extensive sequence data available, such as Hepatitis C and Influenza A viruses.},

  abstract = 	{A new method called the neighbor-joining method is proposed for reconstructing phylogenetic trees from evolutionary distance data. The principle of this method is to find pairs of operational taxonomic units ({OTUs} [= neighbors]) that minimize the total branch length at each stage of clustering of {OTUs} starting with a starlike tree. The branch lengths as well as the topology of a parsimonious tree can quickly be obtained by using this method. Using computer simulation, we studied the efficiency of this method in obtaining the correct unrooted tree in comparison with that of five other tree-making methods: the unweighted pair group method of analysis, Farris's method, Sattath and Tversky's method, Li's method, and Tateno et al.'s modified Farris method. The new, neighbor-joining method and Sattath and Tversky's method are shown to be generally better than the other methods.},

The sophisticated mathematical analysis of that data is just beginning. The Eighteenth Annual Symposium on Some Mathematical Questions in Biology was held in conjunction with the Annual Meeting of the AAAS and brought together speakers knowledgeable in both biology and mathematics to discuss these developments and to emphasize the need for rigorous, efficient computational tools.These computational tools include biologically relevant definitions of sequence similarity and string matching algorithms. The solutions for some of these problems have great generality; the string matching methods first developed for biological sequences have now been applied to areas such as geology,linguistics, and speech recognition. There is a great potential here for creating of new mathematics to handle this growing data base, with new applications for many areas of mathematics, computer science, and statistics.}},

  abstract = 	{We consider three approaches for estimating the rates of nonsynonymous and synonymous changes at each site in a sequence alignment in order to identify sites under positive or negative selection: (1) a suite of fast likelihood-based "counting methods" that employ either a single most likely ancestral reconstruction, weighting across all possible ancestral reconstructions, or sampling from ancestral reconstructions; (2) a random effects likelihood ({REL}) approach, which models variation in nonsynonymous and synonymous rates across sites according to a predefined distribution, with the selection pressure at an individual site inferred using an empirical Bayes approach; and (3) a fixed effects likelihood ({FEL}) method that directly estimates nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates at each site. All three methods incorporate flexible models of nucleotide substitution bias and variation in both nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates across sites, facilitating the comparison between the methods. We demonstrate that the results obtained using these approaches show broad agreement in levels of Type I and Type {II} error and in estimates of substitution rates. Counting methods are well suited for large alignments, for which there is high power to detect positive and negative selection, but appear to underestimate the substitution rate. A {REL} approach, which is more computationally intensive than counting methods, has higher power than counting methods to detect selection in data sets of intermediate size but may suffer from higher rates of false positives for small data sets. A {FEL} approach appears to capture the pattern of rate variation better than counting methods or random effects models, does not suffer from as many false positives as random effects models for data sets comprising few sequences, and can be efficiently parallelized. Our results suggest that previously reported differences between results obtained by counting methods and random effects models arise due to a combination of the conservative nature of counting-based methods, the failure of current random effects models to allow for variation in synonymous substitution rates, and the naive application of random effects models to extremely sparse data sets. We demonstrate our methods on sequence data from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 env and pol genes and simulated alignments.},

To investigate the potential of ultra-deep sequencing to screen for dual infection, we compared it to bulk sequence-based synonymous mixture index and the current standard of single genome sequencing. The synonymous mixture index identified samples likely to harbor dual infection, while ultra-deep sequencing captured more intra-host viral diversity than single genome sequencing at approximately 40\% of the cost and 20\% of the laboratory and analysis time. The synonymous mixture index and ultra-deep sequencing are promising methods for rapid and cost-effective systematic identification of {HIV} dual infection.},

  abstract = 	{Probabilistic models of sequence evolution are in widespread use in phylogenetics and molecular sequence evolution. These models have become increasingly sophisticated and combined with statistical model comparison techniques have helped to shed light on how genes and proteins evolve. Models of codon evolution have been particularly useful, because, in addition to providing a significant improvement in model realism for protein-coding sequences, codon models can also be designed to test hypotheses about the selective pressures that shape the evolution of the sequences. Such models typically assume a phylogeny and can be used to identify sites or lineages that have evolved adaptively. Recently some of the key assumptions that underlie phylogenetic tests of selection have been questioned, such as the assumption that the rate of synonymous changes is constant across sites or that a single phylogenetic tree can be assumed at all sites for recombining sequences. While some of these issues have been addressed through the development of novel methods, others remain as caveats that need to be considered on a case-by-case basis. Here, we outline the theory of codon models and their application to the detection of positive selection. We review some of the more recent developments that have improved their power and utility, laying a foundation for further advances in the modeling of coding sequence evolution.},
